Note regarding the use of XML configuration files with AMS: 
by default ION is built with the -DNOEXPAT option to account for 
operating environments that lack the expat XML parsing library 
(for example VxWorks 5.4). 

To enable expat for use with AMS (or other ION components) configure 
ION using the "--with-expat" option and then compile. 

For example: ./configure --with-expat

Information about expat is available here:
https://libexpat.github.io/
